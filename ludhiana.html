  <h>DISTRICT PROFILE</h>
  <p>
    Ludhiana city was founded in the time of Lodhi dynasty which ruled in Delhi from 1451-1526 A.D. The legend goes that two Lodhi chiefs, Yusaf Khan and Nihand Khan were deputed by Sikandar Lodhi (1489-1517 A.D.) to restore order in this region. They camped at the site of present city of Ludhiana which was then a village called Mir Hota. Yusaf Khan went across the river Sutlej in Jalandhar Doab to check Khokhars who were plundering the Doab and made a settlement at Sultanpur while Nihand Khan stayed back and founded the present city at the site of village Mir Hota. The new town was originally known as Lodhi-ana, which means the town of Lodi's. The name later changed to the present name Ludhiana.

Ludhiana is the most advanced agricultural district and plays an important role in directing the shape of Punjab agriculture. It was among the foremost districts of the country where IADP was launched. The total geopraphical area of the district is 3767 sq km. The District has 3 lakh ha of net area sown, almost 100% is double cropped, and some area is even put to 3 crops a year. All is irrigated, mostly by tubewells. The water table is going down at an alarming rate in Ludhiana district and even more seriously around the Ludhiana city blocks. There are 72000 operational holdings of whom, 1/3rd are the small and marginal ones of less than 2 ha. It has the distinction of having the agricultural universities of the state (PAU and GADVASU). It is the central district of the state and farmers from all over the state follow Ludhiana so far as adoption of new technology in agiculture is concerned. Ludhiana district achieved the national productivity award for the year 2004-05 . But for the last seven years the yield of major crops has not shown any significant growth, in fact it has decreased over the last few years.
